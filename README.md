# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Regression

This project uses machine learning to predict housing prices based on features like size, location, and amenities. The goal is to build and evaluate regression models with optimized accuracy.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and exploration
- `src/`: Source code for preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling
- `models/`: Saved models (e.g., .pkl files)
- `outputs/`: Visualizations and result files
- `main.py`: Script to run the pipeline
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## 🔧 Technologies Used
